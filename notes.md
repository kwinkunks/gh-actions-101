# Instructor Notes

## Preliminary steps for lecturer

## Basic content

-   Open repoositry (add link)
-   Start GitHub Codespace
-   Open [actionlint playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/)
-   Go through the GitHub Action settings for forks

### Setting up a First GitHub Action

-   Create a new folder `.github/workflows/`

    ```bash
    $ mkdir -p .github/workflows
    $ tree
    ```

-   Create new workflow file

    ```bash
    $ cd .github/workflows/
    $ touch first_workflow.yml
    ```

    and open in editor.

-   Add content to file

    ```yaml
    name: My first GitHub workflow
    run-name: First workflow # Optional

    # Events triggering the workflow
    on: [push]

    # Group of jobs to run as poart of the workflow
    jobs:
      greet:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "Hello world"
    ```

-   Add file to repository, commit, and push

    ```bash
    $ git add first_workflow.yml
    $ git commit -m "My first workflow"
    $ git push
    ```

-   Go to `Actions` tab of the repository.

    The workflow should run on GitHub (maybe is already finished).

-   Inspect the output. There should be three steps

    1. `Set up job`
    2. `Run echo "Hello world"`
    3. `Complete job`

    Steps 1 and 2 are implicitly added by GitHub.

### Adding a timeout

- Update the job section to have a timeout

```yaml
    jobs:
      greet:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        timeout-minutes: 5
        steps:
          - run: echo "Hello world"
```

### Running own code

- Add another step to run our own code in the `jobs` section

```yaml
  run-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: '3.14'

      - run: python mycode.py
```

-   Inspect the workflow run in the "Actions" tab

    -   There are two jobs run.
    -   The jobs run in parallel

-   Full workflow configuration after this section

```yaml
name: My first GitHub workflow
run-name: First workflow # Optional

# Events triggering the workflow
on: [push]

# Group of jobs to run as poart of the workflow
jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello world"

  run-code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: '3.14'

      - run: python code.py
```

### Testing own code

-   Add two new steps to install the dependencies and run the test

    ```yaml
          - name: Install test dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

          - name: "Run tests"
            run: pytest
    ```

    We can have several commands within a `run` statement!

-   Step through the Action output and check what was printed

### Optional: Adding a Failing step

-   Change a test such that it fails and commit
-   Browse through the repository to see how a failing test looks like

### Refining the workflow

#### Exploring settings related to GitHub Actions

-   Enable CodeQL

    -   Repository must be `public` or part of an organisation that has GitHub
    Advanced Security (GHAS)  features.

-   Go through settings for GitHub Actions

#### Reducing permissions

-   Check out the security tab of the repository. There should be one warning
about having too broad permissions.

-   GitHub generates a `GITUB_TOKEN` witin the job that can be used to carry
out tasks on behalf of the user triggering the workflow. You want to restrict
this such that workflows cannot do anyting bad.

-   We can restrict permissions within the workflow and grant it to jobs as
they need them.

-   Add

    ```yaml
    run-name: First workflow # Optional
    permissions: {}
    ```

    and

    ```yaml
    run-code:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      timeout-minutes: 5
      permissions:
        contents: read
    ```

    This jobs does not need any additional permissions if the repository is
    `public`, but it is needed if the repository is `internal` or `private`.

#### Matrix Builds

-   Let's run and test our code on several Python versions

-   Add a `strategy` section to the `run-code` job

    ```yaml
    permissions:
      contents: read

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [ "3.12", "3.13", "3.14" ]
    ```

    and use the python version when setting up Python

    ```yaml
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    ```

-   Go to the `Actions` tab on the repository and explore the matrix build. It
does look slightly diffrent than before.

#### Additional operating systems

GitHub Action provides runners for different operatin systems. We can also use
this within the matrix strategy. Useful for multi-platform software and
software packaging.

-   Update the configuration to read

    ```yaml
    run-code:
      needs: checks
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
      timeout-minutes: 5
      permissions:
        contents: read

      strategy:
        matrix:
          python-version: [ "3.12", "3.13", "3.14" ]
          os: [ "macos-latest", "windows-latest", "ubuntu-latest" ]
    ```

    Note: This increases the number of jobs to 9. Be cautious when adding more
    parameters inthe matrix to avoid unnecessarily long workflow runs.

#### Actionlint

- [Open actionlint playground](https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/)
- Copy and paste our action and check for suggested improvements


#### Conditionals

-   We can make jobs and steps conditional.

-   Add an additional step to the `run-code` job

    ```yaml
      - name: "Extra step for Python 3.14"
        if: ${{ matrix.python-version == '3.14' }}
        run: echo "Extra step for Python 3.14"
    ```

    and commit to the repository. This step will only be executed if Python
    3.14 is used.

    Note: It is important to use single quotes `'` in the conditional to ensure
    the correct evaluation.

#### Job dependencies

-   We can make steps depend on each other, e.g., to not waste resources
(compute minutes) of jobs.

-   We can add an additional job for (theoretical) checks, e.g. style checks. Add the followuing to the action
    ```yaml
    checks:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      timeout-minutes: 5
      steps:
        - name: Run checks
          run: |
            echo "Run checks"
            sleep 20

    run-code:
      needs: style
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ```

    to have the `run-code` job execute after the `checks` job. The `checks` job
    must succeed for the `run-code` job to start.

-   Check the `Actions` tab in the repository and see how the job dependencies
are indicated.

#### Workflow triggers

-   Only run on push to `main` and pull requests targetting `main`

    Replace

    ```yaml
    on: [push]
    ```

    by

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ "main" ]
    ```

-   Create a new branch and add a new file

```bash
git checkout -b newbranch
touch somefile.txt
git add somefile.txt
git commit -m "New file"
git push
```

-   Check repository website and see that workflow is not running

#### Workflows in pull request

-   Creat a pull request from the pushed branch
-   Verify that the jobs start running in the PR

#### Pre-made GitHub Actions / The GitHub Action Marketplace

-   Navigate to
[https://github.com/marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) and choose
`Actions` -> `All Actions` on the left.

-   Pin GitHub Action to a certain commit hash

## Further topics (Optional)

The topics below are optional and may be covered depending on questions and
time. There is no checkpoint available for this.

### Billing

- [Billing and usage](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/billing-and-usage)
    -   Check the "Billing" section in the user account.

- [Security hardening of Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use)

### Slack integration

One can send messages from GitHub to Slack. This can be helpful for monitoring
of failing jobs.

### Creating Downloadable Artifacts

- [Workflow
artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/store-and-share-data)

```yaml
  - name: "Create new file"
    run: echo "Hello world!" >> new_file.txt

  - name: "Upload Artifact"
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: my-artifact
      path: new_file.txt
      retention-days: 5
```

- A similar action is available for downloading artifacts in a job. This can be
used to share data between jobs.

### Running Action within a Docker container

-   [Using containerized services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/use-containerized-services)


```yaml
jobs:
  # Label of the container job
  container-job:
    # Containers must run in Linux based operating systems
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Docker Hub image that `container-job` executes in
    container: python:3.14-slim
```

- This will not contain the the same preinstalled software that you get on a
GitHub runner!
