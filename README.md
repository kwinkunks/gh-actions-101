# GitHub Actions 101

This repository contains the content used for a introductionary workshop about
GitHub Actions. The intendent workshop length is 45-60 minutes. The idea of the
workshop is that the instructor goes through the repository and steps required
in a live session such that students could potentially follow along. This also
repends a bit on whether one wants to allow for questions during the tutorial
Please be aware that GitHub Actions are actively developed by GitHub and this
workshop may be out of date.

The `notes.md` file in this repository contains the lecturer's notes. If you
want to follow along during the workshop, but get lost or want to see a command
again, check if it is available in the `notes.md`.
